#Heatmap generator for the Hrydra regeneration transcriptome data

This is a very basic script that allows the creation of heatmaps for the transcriptome data provided by Petersen et al. 2015 doi: [10.1093/molbev/msv079](https://doi.org/10.1093%2Fmolbev%2Fmsv079)

IDs can be found by BLASTing in the Hydra Genome 2.0 Project Portal ([https://research.nhgri.nih.gov/hydra/]()).
